        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p class="os-paragraph1">
            We both grew up in the small town of Athens, Alabama, and went to Clements High School. But even though we walked the same halls, we didn’t really notice each other until 10th grade. Cole started trying to talk to Darby, but at first, she wouldn’t give him the time of day. (Oops.) Eventually, though, he broke through, and we went on our first date to Rosie’s in Florence, Alabama. From there, we started falling in love throughout high school.
        </p>
        <p class="os-paragraph2">
            It was almost too cliché to be real—he was the quarterback, and she was the valedictorian—but beyond all of that, we were truly best friends. Life took us in different directions for a while, and we broke up before Darby left for Auburn. But in the summer of 2022, God brought us back together, and this time, we knew it was forever.
        </p>
        <p class="os-paragraph3">
            On July 12, 2024, Cole proposed at the Huntsville Botanical Garden, and Darby (of course) said yes! We’ve been by each other’s side through years of school—Cole graduated with a degree in aerospace engineering from the University of Alabama in Huntsville in May 2024, and Darby will graduate with her Doctor of Pharmacy degree from Auburn University’s Harrison College of Pharmacy in May 2026. After three years of long distance, we’re beyond excited to start this new season of life together back in our hometown and finally share the same last name!
        </p>
        <p class="os-paragraph4">
            One of our favorite things to do together is trying new restaurants. We also love fun experiences—whether it’s candle-making, stargazing at the observatory, or (one of our personal favorites) a little retail therapy. We can’t wait to continue making memories together as husband and wife!
